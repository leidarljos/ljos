# Changelog

Versions follow semver at 0.x: a minor bump is a feature, a patch is a fix.

## Unreleased

- The doctor's host key row fails when the deed store's `layout` does not
  list the key (`deedar host`), instead of reading healthy while every new
  deed fails `evidence`.

- A seat record carries the conversation ids its writer held, and a shell
  refuses a record written under an id it shares with another
  conversation. Two conversations started from one terminal share the line
  editor's session id, and a shell could take the other conversation's
  holder and then fail to finish its own claim.

- `ljos` and `ljos-mcp` expand a leading `~` in `ISSUE_ROOT` and
  `VISSUE_ROOT` at start. The linked tracker crate took such a root as
  relative to the working directory, so `ljos finish` could not find a
  ticket `vissue` itself resolved.

- `ljos sitting` after its claim and `ljos finish` at the end commit the
  ticket's tracker file (that file only) and push it, when the tracker is a
  git checkout. A closure that stayed in one working tree was lost to every
  other host. `LJOS_TRACKER_GIT=commit` commits without pushing; `=off`
  skips it. A refused push is reported and does not fail the verb.

- On a fresh host the doctor's claim graph row reads ok, `none yet; the
  first claim creates it at DIR`, instead of a failing row in every
  sitting header. Any other claimdag refusal still fails it.

- The doctor's tracker row names the root vissue resolved, its prefix, and
  where the root came from (`ISSUE_ROOT`, `VISSUE_ROOT`, seat config or the
  working directory). A relative or missing root, or one with no prefix
  directory, fails the row.

- Onboarding retains registration and skill result order while initializing
  the pack and host key before configuring the client.

- Forecast scoring accepts the decimal strings emitted by the tracker as
  well as JSON numbers. Invalid probabilities are reported instead of being
  silently treated as absent forecasts.

- Doctor checks that the installed tracker accepts evidence citations and
  forecast confidence on ballots. An incompatible vote command fails the
  required tracker row, even when its version is listed in the registry.

## 0.17.0 (2026-09-21)

- `ljos hud` opens the summonable icedtea pane (`ljos-hud`, a workspace
  member): due, claims, trust canvas, island, and the deed rail. The
  `ljos` crate does not link iced. Pane behavior is the 0.16.3 notes.
- Five playbooks (`sit`, `arena`, `land`, `company-panel`, `overnight`) are
  kind `playbook`, weighed not recalled. `ljos playbooks` lists them;
  `ljos playbook ISSUE NAME` binds one and copies the full recipe body.
  The name is a tracker `playbook:` note until finish or release; those
  verbs write an empty `playbook:` sentinel so the next sitting does not
  reprint it. A different name while one is held is refused. `ljos sitting
  ISSUE --playbook NAME` (MCP `playbook`) prints `== playbook` with that
  body before recall; absent a name, a closed-set token in the title else
  `sit`, so a sitting always binds one of the five before claim. Pack
  latest per name is the copy source; shipped bodies seed only when the
  pack has no live atom of that name. Write, list, bind, and copy refuse
  names outside the five.
- The unscoped inbound floor a persona is owed is the seat's own row
  (`from` is the seat). A third-party unscoped row does not skip it.
- `ljos brief` carries three blocks: the bound playbook's full recipe,
  five named principles (split-fence, prove-on-real-surface,
  open-sibling-first, arena-then-compose, one-step-delegate), and the
  arena rubric. `ljos panel` refuses until a playbook is bound.
  Model names on a recipe are optional spawn hints; every panel still
  ends in `ljos vote --as` then `ljos consensus`.
- Writing a persona also writes one unscoped inbound trust row (the seat
  weighs it at 1, everywhere). `--about` on a later trust row only adds
  weight.

## 0.16.3 (2026-09-22)

- `ljos hud` execs sibling `ljos-hud` (`LJOS_HUD_BIN`, same directory, then
  PATH). Missing is 127; `--hide` with nothing running is 0. The `ljos`
  crate does not link iced. Dist ships the HUD on
  `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` only.
- `ljos-hud` is a long-lived icedtea daemon: summon socket
  (`LJOS_HUD_SOCKET`, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ljos/hud.sock`), overlay
  `me.rgoswami.ljos-hud`, pop-out `me.rgoswami.ljos-hud.window` (P),
  StatusNotifier tray id and `.desktop` `StartupWMClass` are the overlay
  app_id, `--install-desktop`, guest `xdg_activation_v1`. Default
  detaches; `--foreground` stays attached. First-start `--show`/`--toggle`
  keeps `XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN` for the owner (hide still unsets without
  activating). Overlay `Closed` hides. Three read-only panes over library
  APIs: due (with `due_at`, overdue when `due_at` is past, later when
  future, ungraded when empty; no exact-equality `due` chip;
  `review_summary`, display-only grade chips),
  claims (assignee, `cas_gen`, occupancy, lease remaining), a trust-graph
  canvas (personas ∪ trust endpoints, stroke by weight, ring by
  `(1 - anchor)`, missing persona a hollow disk, dashed when scoped),
  island (`packset_search` plus `packset_island(cue, false)`; idle until
  enter; `format_island` weak/dense banners; search-down is a banner), and a deed
  rail (`ljos_cli::timeline_events` → `Vec<Event>`; idle until the
  operator enters an issue; tracker rows from
  `vissue_core::agent::show_json`, not `vissue show --json`). Skip chips sit in
  the layout in key order 1-5 (due, claims, graph, island, deeds). Watch
  `work.bin` plus pack `last_write_ts` (Snap stamps both; a missing
  `pack_ts` is boot, not a load); the 50 ms tick is chrome. A
  habitat that is down is an icedtea banner and a status page; pack-down
  and honest-empty differ, and a claims banner does not blank an up-empty
  graph. HUD sources never call `graded` / `post_atom` / `sweep` /
  `fire=true` / `due_report` / `complete`.
  `ljos doctor` lists `ljos-hud` and does not require it. crates.io
  publishes `-p ljos-hud` after `-p ljos`. The HUD crate does not copy
  the CLI launcher (`resolve_hud_bin` stays in `ljos-cli`).
- `ljos remember` and `ljos search` start the default writer when none is
  answering. `PACKSET_URL=off` stays off. A URL pointed elsewhere is not
  replaced. The crates.io description and keywords name the first command.
- `ljos finish` no longer closes the tracker ticket on `--status done`; a
  sitting ending is not the work being accepted, and a ticket closed early
  released every blocker on it. `--close` (`close` over MCP) closes it.
  The protocol document already said so; the tool now agrees.
- `--gen` on `ljos finish` and `ljos complete` (and `gen` over MCP) is
  optional: absent, the live generation is read off the claim graph. An
  explicit stale generation is still refused.
- `ljos claim`, and so a sitting, stamps the tracker as well as the claim
  graph: `vissue claim ISSUE` runs under the assignee's name, so the issue
  reads STARTED and `vissue claims` names who holds it. A tracker that
  refuses the name fails the claim with `ljos release` named as the way
  out; a node the tracker does not know is left alone.

## 0.16.2 (2026-09-22)

- Doctor compares the `ljos-mcp` binary to the `ljos` crate. That crate
  ships the binary; the crates.io name `ljos-mcp` stopped at 0.14.0.
- A sitting sweeps the review clock before it prints the due prefix, the
  same sweep `ljos due` already ran.
- `ljos_due` returns the soonest eight claims, the total due, and the
  clock summary. The full list stays `ljos due`.
- A panel that matches no domain seats only the personas that name no
  domain. It does not seat every specialist in the pack.
- `ljos vote` prints a count and says so. The settle stays `ljos consensus`.
- An island prints whose weights it walked, and whether fire rewrote them.
  Activation is spread along links, not a rank. A persona brief says to
  walk its own island and to fire only after that island was used.
- A search score is a rank from the scorers, named as such. Learn names
  the rows it rewrote and says the call is not a settle. Finish names
  that the island it fires is the seat's.
- A ballot can state a probability and the deeds it used. The probability
  is the voter's initial opinion and, once an outcome is known, a Brier
  score. The score is not a trust weight. A fire records a trace of the
  links it strengthened.
- A stated probability is also scored by the logarithmic score. The
  voter's running record keeps mean probability against the event rate,
  and from the second forecast Murphy's reliability, resolution, and
  uncertainty. Those scores stay off the trust weight.
## 0.16.1 (2026-09-20)

- `cargo binstall ljos` takes the GitHub tarball (`ljos` and `ljos-mcp`)
  and skips cargo-quickinstall, which only had `ljos`.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` runs `scripts/herd.sh` after the four loops, so the
  herd sits beside the smoke in the release check.

## 0.16.0 (2026-09-20)

- `ljos bump-plan BUNDLE --project P --parent I` puts an eb-stack bundle
  on the tracker: one child issue per module the lock builds, blocked by
  the modules built before it along the SBOM's dependency edges, with ids
  that are a hash of module and generation so a rerun holds what exists.
  `vissue ready` is then the buildable frontier and a sitting refuses the
  rest. `ljos_bump_plan` over MCP; `--dry-run` prints the rows.

## 0.15.0 (2026-09-20)

- A sitting reads the issue's blockers from the tracker before it claims:
  an issue whose blockers are still open is refused, with the blockers
  and their states named, and nothing is claimed. `ljos sitting ISSUE
  --anyway` (MCP `anyway: true`) sits on it regardless and says so. The
  claim graph and the tracker's graph agree on what is workable.

## 0.14.3 (2026-09-20)

- `ljos findings --issue` run twice on one state file cites the deed the
  first run froze instead of failing on the store's refusal.

## 0.14.2 (2026-09-20)

- `ljos findings --issue` reads the accession out of `id=deed-...`, which
  is what `deedar create` prints; the first run against a real campaign
  wrote its lessons and then failed to cite the state file.

## 0.14.1 (2026-09-20)

- A finding names the module whose build failed (`GCCcore-15.2.0` for
  `eOn-2.17.10-foss-2026.1`), read from EasyBuild's own line, not only
  the recipe the campaign drives; the lesson and its entities carry both.
  A finding a later attempt got past says so in its second sentence
  instead of quoting the campaign's automatic resolution.
- A pack refusal on prose reaches the MCP client with what passes, so the
  second attempt is not a guess; four runners hit the ceiling on their
  first lesson.
- The `ljos` crate is the one published: it carries the `ljos-mcp` binary,
  so `cargo install ljos` and `cargo binstall ljos` install both. The
  `ljos-mcp` package stays in the workspace unpublished; the crate already
  on crates.io stays where it is.

## 0.14.0 (2026-09-20)

- `ljos findings STATE` reads an eb-stack campaign state file and prints
  its typed findings; `--remember` writes one lesson per finding a person
  or a seat resolved (the recipe, the step, the error line, the fix) under
  the recipe's name, its package and the failure class; `--issue` cites
  the state file as a deed. `ljos_findings` over MCP. The protocol and
  the how-to carry the bump: one island per recipe before it is touched,
  the ladder rung by rung, the findings remembered after.
- A claim leaves a hold record beside the claim graph: the name it is
  held under, the seat, the runner process and when. A sitting that finds
  the node held by another conversation now names it and says whether its
  runner still runs; when the holder is this seat's own conversation and
  its runner is gone, the sitting takes the node over. A runner that
  exited without finishing no longer blocks the next run of the same
  seat.
- `ljos_remember` says what the pack refuses: a third sentence, prose
  above readability grade 14; and what a lesson names.
- `ljos onboard --example` carries the runners this seat has carried
  through one piece of work (opencode, hermes, omp, grok beside the two
  generic shapes), each in the shape it takes the server; the how-to says
  which take the memory hook.

## 0.13.8 (2026-09-20)

- A conversation's holder does not move when a second `*_SESSION_ID`
  appears: the first resolution leaves a record under every stamped id,
  and a later process carrying one of them and more finds the holder by
  the shared id. A sitting opened under one id is finished under it when
  a line editor has stamped another since.
- `ljos doctor` says where a registry answer came from (`crates.io
  (cached)` when read from the day cache) and labels a binary ahead of it
  as well as one behind; a cached answer the binary on `PATH` is already
  ahead of is asked again.
- `ljos_policy` returns what `ljos policy` prints: the TCB verdict, the
  rule that fired and the memories the line activates, under `ruling`.
  `ljos_consensus` runs the surprisingly popular answer and the voters'
  standing beside the settle, as `ljos consensus` does.
- The `ljos-mcp` crate page carries the README.

## 0.13.7 (2026-09-20)

- `ljos onboard` registers into a runner's JSON config by pointer: a
  harness names `config_json`, `json_pointer` and a `json_entry` template
  (opencode's `mcp` object, for one), and registered means the pointer
  resolves.

## 0.13.6 (2026-09-20)

- Every MCP tool answers an object: the ten that answered a bare array
  now answer `{ rows: [...] }`, since a strict client refused the whole
  server over an array output schema.

- A persona's memory tree: `remember --as` and `prefer --as` write into
  the set `persona-NAME`, its own tree for the duplicate and replacement
  rules; `ljos island --as NAME` and the `ljos_island` tool's `as` walk
  the pack through the persona's own link weights and fire those, not
  the seat's. Facts stay one substrate; readings and paths are the
  persona's. `packset-client` 0.9.20.

## 0.13.5 (2026-09-20)

- A finish says when the island fired already this hour (the pack holds
  a second fire of the same claims for an hour, so several seats or
  personas closing sittings on one issue tighten its links once).
  `scripts/herd.sh` runs eight sittings from four seats at once, contends
  one ticket between two seats, and closes all eight in parallel.

## 0.13.4 (2026-09-19)

- The roster, a brief and the panel prompt read only the persona atoms
  (`packset-client` 0.9.17), not every atom in the workspace.
- `ljos doctor` has a memory row: the live count against the cap and
  the claims forgotten, by reason (packset 0.9.17 counts them).
- Writing a persona that the pack already holds supersedes its previous
  atom, so moving an anchor or a view leaves one live persona of that
  name; the roster showed one, the pack kept both.

## 0.13.3 (2026-09-19)

- `ljos personas` and the `ljos_personas` tool print the roster the pack
  holds: name, anchor, the domains each speaks to, its view. The only
  way to see it was the panel prompt.
- `ljos due` sweeps the pack first and says what the sweep did: reviews
  left due past twice their interval lapse, never-recalled claims missed
  three times are forgotten by neglect, and the list that follows is the
  one after that. `packset-client` 0.9.14.

## 0.13.2 (2026-09-19)

- A panel seats only the personas whose domains the issue speaks to,
  read from its title's words and the island it activates; every persona
  sits when none speaks to it. The `ljos panel` brief and the
  `run_a_panel` prompt agree on the roster, and the prompt says how many
  of the pack it seated.
- `ljos onboard --harness grok` bumps `LJOS_MCP_GENERATION` in the runner
  config when the crate version moved, so Grok's watcher respawns
  `ljos-mcp` and a session restart is not required.

## 0.13.1 (2026-09-19)

- The holder is any `*_SESSION_ID` the runner set, the full value, ahead
  of the process tag. Two ids that share an eight-character prefix occupy
  different slots. A server sitting and a shell sitting of one session
  are one occupancy name.
- `ljos finish ISSUE` with status done (the default) closes the ticket
  in the tracker, so a board never shows TODO over a completed claim and
  hands the work out again. Failed or cancelled leaves the ticket where
  it is. Completing a node alone still does not close a ticket.
- The server's seat record is also kept under each conversation id the
  runner stamped, and a shell reads it by any id it shares with the
  server. A line editor that stamps a session id of its own into the
  shell no longer makes that shell a second holder.
- Every write names the seat that wrote it (`seat:<name>` first among
  the entities; a persona's, a habit's or a trust row's entities join it,
  a trust row's stay the deeds it cites). A hit written by another seat
  says so: `[lesson, 3 days ago, from brio]` in the hook and a brief,
  `(from brio)` in `ljos search`, `from` on the `ljos_search` row. Many
  seats share one pack; a reader now sees whose lesson it is reading.
- `packset-client` 0.9.12, whose hits carry entities and whose writer
  holds a workspace at a live cap.

## 0.13.0 (2026-09-19)

- The doctor keeps each crates.io answer on disk for a day, so a herd of
  seats opening sittings asks the registry once a day per binary rather
  than once a sitting each. A busy refusal names this conversation's
  holder and the release that frees a conversation that is gone.
- Habits: `ljos habit NAME VALUE [--unit U] [--every 7d] [--source S]`
  takes a reading of a number the seat keeps measuring, as a claim of
  kind `habit` that supersedes the earlier reading and carries it as
  `was`, due for its next reading one cadence on; `ljos habit` lists
  them with the change since the last reading and when the next is due.
  `ljos_habit` is the same over MCP.
- The seat names itself. `ljos-mcp` takes the client's name at initialize
  (`acme-cli`, `brio`, whatever the runner says) as the seat and
  leaves a record under the runtime directory keyed by the runner's
  process; `ljos` in a shell that runner opened walks its own process tree
  to the same record, or to the first ancestor that is not a shell, so a
  runner's tools and its verbs are one seat with nothing set and nothing
  in `env`. Two names: the seat, which memory, ballots and trust accrue to
  across conversations, and the holder (`acme-cli-39u`), which this
  conversation's claims are held under. `ljos seat` prints both; the
  doctor's `seat` row does too. `LJOS_SEAT` still overrides. The runners
  file no longer passes `LJOS_SEAT={name}`; `ljos onboard` alone prints
  the one entry any runner takes. A ballot cast without a persona is cast
  as the seat.
- `cargo install ljos` installs `ljos` and `ljos-mcp`.
- Occupancy is `{holder}:{issue}` and the holder is any `*_SESSION_ID` the
  runner stamped, else the seat tagged with the conversation's process,
  else `LJOS_SEAT`. No product list. Two conversations hold two tickets;
  the same ticket is still one holder. `doctor` prints the session and
  which variable it came from.

## 0.12.15 (2026-09-15)

- Sitting no longer treats a binary behind crates.io as a habitat
  that does not answer. Doctor still names the gap.

## 0.12.14 (2026-09-15)

- The README no longer says the hook never blocks. A TCB deny on
  PreToolUse still blocks.

## 0.12.13 (2026-09-14)

- `ljos remember` and `prefer` print one line (id, kind, due, text).
  They no longer dump the embedding.

## 0.12.12 (2026-09-14)

- `packset-client` 0.9.2, so the seat tracks the writer that prints
  `packset-mcp --version`.

## 0.12.11 (2026-09-14)

- Doctor times out MCP `--version` so a silent stdio server cannot
  hang the seat. `ljos-mcp` depends on the workspace ljos version.

## 0.12.10 (2026-09-14)

- `packset-client` 0.9.1. `ljos-mcp --version` prints and exits.
  Doctor can version the MCP binary. The door install includes
  `packset-embed`.

## 0.12.9 (2026-09-14)

- `ljos doctor` lists every seat binary (`ljos`, `packset-embed`,
  `packset-mcp`, …) with the version on PATH against crates.io. A
  part that is missing or behind is not ok. Encoder and policyd are
  required with the rest.

## 0.12.8 (2026-09-14)

- `ljos doctor` treats the grok harness hook as the frozen events
  (prompt, PostToolUse, Bash rules, SessionEnd), not a stale
  SessionStart list. `~/.config/ljos/env` is loaded when those
  keys are unset, so a shell `ljos` shares the MCP pack. Argv law
  runs only on PreToolUse and argv, not on PostToolUse.

## 0.12.7 (2026-09-14)

- `ljos onboard --harness grok` writes the frozen `~/.grok/hooks/ljos.json`.
  No table in harnesses.toml is required.

## 0.12.6 (2026-09-14)

- Grok hook is `ljos hook` only. The prompt's pack text is held and
  emitted once on `PostToolUse`, the event Grok delivers. No
  `sync.sh`. `PreToolUse` stays rules-only.

## 0.12.5 (2026-09-14)

- Grok `PreToolUse` no longer remaps to a pack search. The inject
  script exits on a tool call. `ljos hook` on Bash only decides
  rules. The due nudge no longer walks `consolidate` (that sitting
  is what timed the hook out at 20s).

- `finish` does not fire a weak island (seeds no two scorers agreed on)
  and says why; `island` marks one as weak and as the pack's
  best-connected cluster rather than what the cue is about; `doctor`
  shows the encoder row, since a down encoder is what makes seeds weak.

## 0.12.4 (2026-09-14)

- Grok onboard writes `GROK_SESSION_ID` into the MCP env so the
  occupancy split in 0.12.3 is live for that runner.

## 0.12.3 (2026-09-14)

- Occupancy uses the runner session when the assignee is a shared
  name (`grok`, `seat`, `you`). Two conversations hold two tickets.

## 0.12.0 (2026-09-13)

- `learn` writes rows from each voter's record: hits and misses so far
  as log-odds weights, the same scale `calibrate` writes, carried on the
  rows. On voters of known accuracy the record reaches batch calibration
  (0.929 against 0.934 over 8000 decisions) where Hedge reaches 0.831 and
  Hedge with recovery 0.877. `--rule hedge` keeps the shrink.
- `conflicts` leaves out passes between trust rows, personas, forecasts
  and rules: weighed, not recalled, so not contradictions to judge.

## 0.11.0 (2026-09-13)

- `conflicts` (and the `ljos_conflicts` tool): candidate contradictions
  by geometry, the lowest passes between single memories in the pack's
  embedding landscape, from the optional `landscape` habitat; nothing
  written.
- The hook reads a correction: a prompt that opens with "do you not
  remember", "you should have", "I told you" and the like gets one line,
  once per cue a session, to write the preference or lesson into the pack
  before the work. A correction the pack never held cannot fire.

## 0.10.0 (2026-09-12)

- `doctor` prints a `seat` row: the name this runner claims and votes
  under, and whether it came from `LJOS_SEAT`, `VISSUE_AGENT` or the
  default.
- `calibrate` writes log-odds weights (Nitzan and Paroush): a voter right
  nine times in ten now outweighs one right six times in ten five to one,
  where the linear rule gave three to two; chance earns the floor.
- `search` prints how many scorers named each hit; the prompt nudge counts
  the pairs `consolidate` would close beside the claims due.
- `consolidate` (and the `ljos_consolidate` tool): the pack's replacement
  rule run over what it holds, pairs reported, `--apply` to write.
- The hook injects only hits at least two of the pack's scorers named
  (`ballots` of `of` on a hit), when more than one ran; a claim one
  scorer alone matched on a command line stays in the pack.
- A second `sitting` on an issue this name already holds is a sitting
  resumed: the lease is renewed and the verb goes on, where it refused
  with `claim: status claimed`. Held by another seat, the refusal names
  the actor.

## 0.9.0 (2026-09-12)

- Every recalled memory carries its age: the hook's lines, a brief's
  lines, `search` and the island in `sitting` say `today`, `3 weeks ago`,
  `6 months ago` beside the kind, and the hook's lessons run oldest to
  newest behind the preferences. The reader lays what it recalls on a
  timeline instead of a bag.
- `timeline ISSUE` (and the `ljos_timeline` tool): the tracker's logbook,
  the cited deeds and the activated memories as one dated list, oldest
  first, each line with its age and the gap since the line before.
  `sitting` prints the last twelve as `== timeline`.
- Two runners on one host: `--assignee` defaults to `LJOS_SEAT`, then
  `VISSUE_AGENT`, then `seat`; a ballot cast without a persona is cast as
  `LJOS_SEAT` when set; the runners file may write `{name}` in `register`
  and `snippet`, so a registration passes `LJOS_SEAT={name}` to the server.
- `remember` and `finish` say when the pack closed earlier memories for
  the new one (`revises N earlier memories, now closed`), so a revision is
  seen as one.
- `search --as-of TIME` (and `as_of` on the `ljos_search` tool): the pack
  as it stood then, so "what did the seat know when it decided that" has
  an answer.

## 0.8.0 (2026-09-12)

- `scripts/smoke.sh`: every loop on scratch stores, as a check.
- `sitting` prints the island's strongest eight; `island` prints it all.
- A habitat cut off by the seat's own reader closing the pipe is not a
  refusal: `ljos consensus ID | head` ends quietly.

## 0.7.0 (2026-09-12)

- `learn --share S`: a fixed share of recovery toward one after the Hedge
  step (Herbster and Warmuth), so a voter refuted long ago can come back;
  zero, the default, is plain Hedge.
- `receive --import` tags every imported atom with its sender
  (`from:<signing key>`, or `from:handover` for an unsigned bag).
- `onboard` starts a pack writer when none answers, before wiring the
  runner to it.
- The hook fires the memories it injected during a session together when
  the session ends (the runner's `SessionEnd` event, on by default), so
  what served one sitting is wired for the next.

## 0.6.0 (2026-09-12)

- `ljos hubs`: the claims the pack's link graph turns on, highest first.
- `handover --to user@host:path` copies the sealed, signed bag to another
  seat over ssh; the receiver runs `ljos receive`.
- `predict ISSUE --expect OPTION` records a forecast of the others; with
  two or more, `consensus` prints the surprisingly popular answer (Prelec,
  Seung and McCoy) and, with trust rows, each voter's EigenTrust standing.
- `rule PATTERN --verdict deny|ask --why TEXT`: argv law in the pack. The
  hook returns the verdict as the runner's permission decision on tool
  calls; `policy` prints it beside the line. Over MCP: `ljos_predict`,
  `ljos_rule`.

## 0.5.0 (2026-09-12)

- `ljos search -n N --rerank`: the writer's cross-encoder over the top hits.
- `ljos panel ISSUE --out DIR`: every persona's brief as a file, so a runner
  without MCP can start one subagent per persona.
- `remember --as NAME` and `prefer --as NAME` (and `as` on the tools): a
  persona keeps lessons of its own, which open its next `brief`.
- `handover` signs the manifest with the seat's default host key, not only
  with one named by `DEEDAR_HOST_SIGNING_KEY`; it went out unsigned while
  `doctor` reported the key present.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-12)

- The kind of work sets the dynamics: an issue tagged `broad` settles
  under bounded confidence on the model crate; untagged issues run the
  anchored model. On a prompt the hook says, once per session, how many
  claims are due for review. `sitting` no longer waits on the runners'
  command lines; `doctor` asks them beside the seat's own rows.
- `learn` moves a refuted persona's anchor toward one, and a scoped trust
  row that applies stands in for the unscoped row of its pair instead of
  adding to it. Islands print claims only; persona and trust atoms are
  weighed, not recalled.
- `ljos brief NAME ISSUE` and `ljos_brief`: the text a subagent playing a
  persona starts from; `run_a_panel` starts each member from it.
- `--version`. A claim on an issue whose earlier sitting finished reopens
  the session node (`claimdag reopen`) and takes it.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-12)

Memory at the point of action:

- `ljos hook` reads a runner's hook JSON (or an argv line) on stdin and
  answers with the memories the action activates, preferences first, in the
  runner's `additionalContext` shape or plain lines. `onboard` installs it
  on a runner's prompt event when its table names a `hooks` file, or on the
  events `hook_events` lists, and drops it from the rest; `doctor` shows
  the row. The default was settled by a panel of the seat's personas. `ljos policy` prints the memory beside the
  argv line.

Personas and scoped trust:

- `ljos persona NAME --anchor A --view TEXT [--about DOMAIN]` writes a voter
  with a view; `ljos vote --as NAME` casts as it; `consensus` passes every
  persona's anchor to both settles as `--susceptibility-of`.
- Trust rows carry `about` domains: an unscoped row applies everywhere, a
  scoped one when the issue's title carries the word. `learn` writes rows
  scoped to the entities of the issue's island.
- Over MCP: `ljos_persona`, `as` on `ljos_vote`, `about` on `ljos_trust`,
  and the `run_a_panel` prompt: one subagent per persona, one ballot each,
  then the settle.

The loop runs every time:

- `ljos sitting ISSUE --assignee NAME` opens a sitting in the protocol's
  order (doctor, cards, due, island, recall, claim) and stops at the first
  store down; `ljos finish ISSUE [--lesson] [--outcome]` closes it
  (remember, fire, complete, learn) and says when no lesson was given.
  Both over MCP as `ljos_sitting` and `ljos_finish`.
- `ljos calibrate -p PROJECT` writes trust rows from the project's voting
  history with no truth labels (Dawid and Skene, through
  `ljos-consensus reliability`), so weights move when nobody names an
  outcome.
- `ljos due` lists claims that never entered the review clock as due, and
  ends with one line on the clock: due, scheduled, next.
- `ljos onboard` writes the seat's host key when there is none, so
  handovers go out signed.

For an agent, or the person running one:

- `ljos protocol` prints the sitting protocol: which store answers which
  question, the order of verbs before, during and after the work, and the
  refusals worth knowing. The server serves it at `ljos://protocol` and
  names it first in its instructions.
- `ljos onboard --harness NAME [--dry-run]` registers `ljos-mcp` with a
  runner described in `~/.config/ljos/harnesses.toml` and installs the
  protocol as its skill; `--harness json` prints the entry for any other,
  `--example` the file's shape. `doctor` reports whether each runner named
  is onboarded.
- `ljos release ID --assignee NAME` and `ljos_release` hand a session node
  back unfinished. A claim refused as busy now names the tracker id the
  name still holds and the two verbs that free it.
- Nothing needs a variable set: the pack is found on `127.0.0.1:8761`
  (`PACKSET_URL=off` means no pack), the seat's memory is the one
  workspace `seat` from any directory (`PACKSET_WORKSPACE` names another),
  and the host key at `~/.config/deedar/host.key`.
- Every verb and flag has help; every tool description opens with when to
  call it; the claim and finish arguments say they take tracker ids.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-12)

The seat over four stores, as one command and one MCP server.

- Memory: `remember`, `prefer`, `forget --why DEED`, `search`, `island
  CUE [--fire]`, `due`, `graded ID [--lapsed]`.
- Agreement: `vote`, `consensus` under the pack's trust rows on both the
  model crate and the tracker's verb, `trust FROM TO W --why DEED`, `learn
  ID --outcome OPTION` (Hedge reweighing, rows written whole).
- Work: `claim` and `complete` take a tracker id or a name and map them to
  claim-graph ids; `deed`, `recall`.
- Handover: `handover --out DIR` packs the satchel, the atoms and the deeds
  both cite, seals and signs; `receive DIR [--since] [--import]` checks and
  imports.
- `doctor` reports every habitat, the host signing key included.
- MCP: twenty-two tools with read/write annotations, two resources, two
  prompts that sequence a sitting and a handover check.
- A documentation site and handbook at https://leidarljos.github.io/ljos/.

## 0.1.0

The first seat: remember, prefer, search, evidence, current, deed, recall,
vote, claim, complete, cards, policy, consensus.
