# Changelog

Versions follow semver at 0.x: a minor bump is a feature, a patch is a fix.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-12)

The seat over four stores, as one command and one MCP server.

- Memory: `remember`, `prefer`, `forget --why DEED`, `search`, `island
  CUE [--fire]`, `due`, `graded ID [--lapsed]`.
- Agreement: `vote`, `consensus` under the pack's trust rows on both the
  model crate and the tracker's verb, `trust FROM TO W --why DEED`, `learn
  ID --outcome OPTION` (Hedge reweighing, rows written whole).
- Work: `claim` and `complete` take a tracker id or a name and map them to
  claim-graph ids; `deed`, `recall`.
- Handover: `handover --out DIR` packs the satchel, the atoms and the deeds
  both cite, seals and signs; `receive DIR [--since] [--import]` checks and
  imports.
- `doctor` reports every habitat, the host signing key included.
- MCP: twenty-two tools with read/write annotations, two resources, two
  prompts that sequence a sitting and a handover check.
- A documentation site and handbook at https://leidarljos.github.io/ljos/.
