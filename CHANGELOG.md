# Changelog

Versions follow semver at 0.x: a minor bump is a feature, a patch is a fix.

## Unreleased

The loop runs every time:

- `ljos sitting ISSUE --assignee NAME` opens a sitting in the protocol's
  order (doctor, cards, due, island, recall, claim) and stops at the first
  store down; `ljos finish ISSUE [--lesson] [--outcome]` closes it
  (remember, fire, complete, learn) and says when no lesson was given.
  Both over MCP as `ljos_sitting` and `ljos_finish`.
- `ljos calibrate -p PROJECT` writes trust rows from the project's voting
  history with no truth labels (Dawid and Skene, through
  `ljos-consensus reliability`), so weights move when nobody names an
  outcome.
- `ljos due` lists claims that never entered the review clock as due, and
  ends with one line on the clock: due, scheduled, next.
- `ljos onboard` writes the seat's host key when there is none, so
  handovers go out signed.

For an agent, or the person running one:

- `ljos protocol` prints the sitting protocol: which store answers which
  question, the order of verbs before, during and after the work, and the
  refusals worth knowing. The server serves it at `ljos://protocol` and
  names it first in its instructions.
- `ljos onboard --harness NAME [--dry-run]` registers `ljos-mcp` with a
  runner described in `~/.config/ljos/harnesses.toml` and installs the
  protocol as its skill; `--harness json` prints the entry for any other,
  `--example` the file's shape. `doctor` reports whether each runner named
  is onboarded.
- `ljos release ID --assignee NAME` and `ljos_release` hand a session node
  back unfinished. A claim refused as busy now names the tracker id the
  name still holds and the two verbs that free it.
- Nothing needs a variable set: the pack is found on `127.0.0.1:8761`
  (`PACKSET_URL=off` means no pack) and the host key at
  `~/.config/deedar/host.key`.
- Every verb and flag has help; every tool description opens with when to
  call it; the claim and finish arguments say they take tracker ids.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-12)

The seat over four stores, as one command and one MCP server.

- Memory: `remember`, `prefer`, `forget --why DEED`, `search`, `island
  CUE [--fire]`, `due`, `graded ID [--lapsed]`.
- Agreement: `vote`, `consensus` under the pack's trust rows on both the
  model crate and the tracker's verb, `trust FROM TO W --why DEED`, `learn
  ID --outcome OPTION` (Hedge reweighing, rows written whole).
- Work: `claim` and `complete` take a tracker id or a name and map them to
  claim-graph ids; `deed`, `recall`.
- Handover: `handover --out DIR` packs the satchel, the atoms and the deeds
  both cite, seals and signs; `receive DIR [--since] [--import]` checks and
  imports.
- `doctor` reports every habitat, the host signing key included.
- MCP: twenty-two tools with read/write annotations, two resources, two
  prompts that sequence a sitting and a handover check.
- A documentation site and handbook at https://leidarljos.github.io/ljos/.

## 0.1.0

The first seat: remember, prefer, search, evidence, current, deed, recall,
vote, claim, complete, cards, policy, consensus.
