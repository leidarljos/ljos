                Pass `fire` true only after it has used that island: fire rewrites its weights, \

                The line that comes back is a count. The settle is the next step. \

                Polarization is how far voters still sit from the mean. Disagreement is \
                how far neighbors still sit from each other. Both zero with one option \
                means there was one option. Act on the shares when polarization is about \
                zero and two or more options were named. When polarization is away from \
                zero, the mean is not a position the group reached. A count printed later \
                is who voted.\n\
             4. When the world later says which option \
                was right, `ljos_learn` on {issue} with that outcome, and the personas that \
                were wrong lose weight on this topic.\n\n\
