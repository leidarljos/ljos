3. Rubric in brief. `ljos brief` carries the playbook step, these principles, and this sheet.
4. One-step delegate. Subagent = one playbook step. No resume across phases.
5. Unscoped inbound trust. Every panel persona has one unscoped inbound row; `--about` only adds weight.
6. No second plugin. Do not copy 47 skills, poteto-mode, Benny, or Cursor model files.
7. Small surface. Prefer pack atoms and brief fields over a new crate. Musl CLI stays iced-free.

2. Grade due claims (`ljos graded ID`).
3. Do the work on this claim only. Artefacts are deeds, then `ljos deed ISSUE --add ACCESSION`. Lessons are `ljos remember` in two sentences.
4. One playbook step is the whole sitting. A subagent takes this recipe and this issue; it does not resume a later phase.
5. Close with `ljos finish ISSUE --lesson \"...\"`. Completing the node does not close the ticket. `ljos finish ISSUE --close` does, when the work is accepted.

3. The host writes a compose child and a rubric with named axes. Personas vote the compose `--as`.
4. Spawn hints are optional model-family names on this atom. Each subagent still ends with `ljos vote ISSUE --for accept|reject --as NAME`. No graft. PASS on an axis is not GREEN.
5. `ljos consensus ISSUE` settles under trust rows and DeGroot. `ljos vote --as` stays.

3. `ljos brief NAME ISSUE` reprints this recipe in full, the five named principles, and the arena rubric.
4. One subagent per persona, optional model-family spawn hints. Each casts `ljos vote ISSUE --for OPTION --as NAME`. Then `ljos consensus ISSUE`.
5. Do not resume across phases. A new task is a new sitting.
