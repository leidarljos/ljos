# ljos

What does this seat do next? One seat over five habitats and argv law. Each habitat keeps its own crate.

```
cargo binstall ljos packset
ljos remember "The lexical default is BM25+. It beat BM25 by two points on turns."
07be8829... lesson due 2026-09-26T23:27:31.528Z
ljos search lexical default
1.0000 3/3 lesson 07be8829... today The lexical default is BM25+. It beat BM25 by two points on turns.
```

That installs `ljos` and `ljos-mcp`. `ljos remember` starts the writer when none is answering. `cargo install ljos packset` is the same without `cargo-binstall`.

Citing a deed names it; the bytes stay in deedar. Neither a finish nor completing a node closes the ticket; `finish --close` does, when the work is accepted. Cards are read-only. Consensus is a [different crate](https://github.com/leidarljos/consensus).

```

## The loop, in two verbs

`ljos sitting ISSUE [--playbook NAME]` opens a sitting in the protocol's order and stops at the first store that does not answer: doctor, cards, the review clock, the island the issue's title activates, the playbook copied before recall, the working set, the timeline, the claim. Absent `--playbook`, a name already bound, else a closed-set token in the title, else `sit`. The playbook name is a tracker note until finish or release. `ljos panel` refuses until one is bound. `ljos finish ISSUE --lesson "..." [--outcome OPTION]` closes it: the lesson is remembered, the island fires, the session node completes, the ticket closes, and a named outcome shrinks the voters it refuted. The loop that makes the seat a memory runs every time, not only when somebody remembers it.

When the tracker is a git checkout, the claim and the finish each commit the ticket's `issues.org` (that file only) and push it, so another host sees the claim and the closure. `LJOS_TRACKER_GIT=commit` keeps it local; `=off` skips it. `ljos doctor` names how many commits origin lacks and fails the tracker row when that count sits through the push wait.

## Who is sitting

The seat is the program that connected. `ljos-mcp` names it after the client that initialised it, and `ljos` in a shell that runner opened finds the same name through the process tree or a shared session id, so a runner's tools and its verbs are one seat with nothing set. Claims are held per conversation; memory, ballots and trust accrue to the seat. `ljos seat` prints both names and where they came from. `ljos onboard` prints the one MCP entry any runner takes; `ljos protocol` prints the text an agent reads first.

Nothing needs a variable set: `ljos remember` starts the writer when none is answering, the seat's memory is the one workspace `seat` from any directory, and every claim carries the seat that wrote it.

## The smoke test

`scripts/smoke.sh` runs every loop on scratch stores: memory, agreement, learning, a sitting and its finish, a rewrite that closes its earlier claim, habits, an as-of read, a signed handover received and then refused after one byte is altered, a rule through the hook and through `policy`, then two seats (distinct `LJOS_SEAT` and `*_SESSION_ID` each) handing one ticket in sequence (A sits, cites a deed, hands over; B imports; A releases; B sits, both vote, consensus, finish closes, tracker git reports the commit), then `scripts/herd.sh` (eight sittings, one contended ticket, eight finishes, one island fire). `scripts/terra/` holds the Slurm scripts that build, smoke and herd the seat on the build host, as run.

## MCP

`ljos-mcp` serves the same verbs over stdio: thirty-nine tools, each opening with when to call it, the protocol at `ljos://protocol`, the cards read-only at `ljos://cards/`, and three prompts. `ljos_due` returns the soonest eight claims and the total still due. Paste this where the runner keeps its servers:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"ljos": {"command": "ljos-mcp"}}}
```

Unanimous green (two implementers, two reviewers, `ljos consensus` is GREEN) lives in [`examples/unanimous-green/`](examples/unanimous-green/).
