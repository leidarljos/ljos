# ljos

Memory, a work tracker and a shell gate for coding agents: Claude Code, Codex,
Grok Build, Cursor, Antigravity's `agy`, opencode, omp and hermes.

An agent forgets what it learned when the session ends, and it runs whatever
command it decides on. ljos keeps the lessons in a local store and hands the
ones that bear on a prompt back to the agent before it answers. It records the
work on a tracker the agent and the person both read. It checks each shell
command against rules the person wrote before it runs. It works through each
runner's MCP server list and its hooks. Nothing leaves the machine unless you
turn on a remote judge.

## Five minutes

```
cargo binstall ljos packset vissue-cli      # or: cargo install ljos packset vissue-cli
ljos onboard --harness claude               # MCP server, hooks and skill for Claude Code
ljos prefer "Tag a release with git push origin TAG; --follow-tags leaves v-tags behind."
ljos rule '*--force*' --verdict deny --why "Never force push."
```

`--harness` takes `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `cursor`, `antigravity`,
`opencode`, `omp`, `hermes`, `windsurf`, `zed`, `vscode`, `claude-desktop`,
`gemini`, `amazonq` or `kiro`. Cursor's IDE and its `agent` CLI share
`~/.cursor/mcp.json`. Start a new session and ask for something the
preference bears on, such as tagging a release. Before the model reads the
prompt, the hook adds:

```
What this seat already knows that bears on this (from the pack, each with its age, lessons oldest first; `ljos search` for more):
- [preference, today] Tag a release with git push origin TAG; --follow-tags leaves v-tags behind.
```

A preference stands from the moment it is written. A lesson (`ljos remember`)
comes back once a review or a consolidation promotes it; `ljos due` lists the
ones waiting.

A conversation that holds no issue is told, on the first tool result, to
file one and sit. `Stop` holds that turn once when it used tools and never
touched the seat. A conversation that already holds an issue waits forty
tool calls before the reminder to record the work.

## Claude Code plugin

The MCP server, the seat protocol skill, the sitting and finish commands, and
the hooks `ljos onboard --harness claude` registers are one plugin. The
marketplace file is in this repository.

```
claude plugin marketplace add leidarljos/ljos
claude plugin install ljos@leidarljos
claude plugin install vissue@leidarljos
```

`ljos@leidarljos` is this repository: the MCP server, the seat protocol
skill, the sitting and finish commands, and the hooks
`ljos onboard --harness claude` registers. `vissue@leidarljos` is the
tracker server, fetched from `leidarljos/vissue`. `ljos`, `ljos-mcp`, and
`vissue-mcp` stay on `PATH` (`cargo binstall` or `cargo install` for this
repository and for vissue). The plugins run those binaries; they also look
in `~/.cargo/bin` and `~/.local/bin`. packset, deedar, claimdag, consensus,
and ljos-policyd are the programs those binaries call, installed the same
way. Start a new session. `/ljos:sitting ISSUE` opens a sitting and
`/ljos:finish ISSUE --lesson "..."` closes it.
In a checkout, `claude plugin validate .` checks the marketplace and
`claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json` checks the plugin.
Pass `--strict` to fail on warnings.

When the agent then reaches for `git push --force origin main`, the runner
refuses the command before it runs:

```
{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"Never force push. (seat rule `*--force*`)"}
```


## Command consent in chat

Grok Build and Claude show an ask rule as the runner's own permission
prompt. The hook answers `ask`, and approving that prompt runs the command.

An ask rule on a client without a native hook prompt returns a request id.
Call the MCP tool `ljos_request_approval` with that id. A client supporting MCP
form elicitation displays the exact command, directory, conversation and
rule. Select **Allow this command once** and accept the form to authorize
one retry. The grant expires fifteen minutes after the request was created.

Declining, dismissing, leaving the checkbox clear, or a client error grants
nothing. The tool cannot take an approval flag as an argument. A different
command, directory, conversation or rule still requires its own consent,
and deny rules remain binding.

For clients without form elicitation, reply `approve REQUEST_ID` in this
conversation, or run `ljos approve REQUEST_ID` in your own terminal. The
terminal command refuses to run under a coding runner. A chat message that
does not name that id grants nothing.

The MCP connection must load the tool before using it; reconnect after
upgrading from a version without `ljos_request_approval`. A connection that
supports this tool keeps its own consent handler when other calls forward
to an upgraded binary.

Verify the protocol against a built server with:

```sh
python3 scripts/test_approval.py target/debug/ljos-mcp
```

## What you get

- Memory per prompt: one claim per memory, searched with the prompt and
  injected only when it shares the prompt's words or a judge is sure it bears
  on it. Lessons come back on a review clock, and a wrong one is superseded,
  not edited.
- A tracker, [vissue](https://github.com/leidarljos/vissue): plain org files
  in a git repository. `ljos sitting ISSUE` opens the work and claims it;
  `ljos finish ISSUE --lesson "..."` closes the loop and records what it
  taught.
- A gate on shell commands: rules in the pack (`ljos rule`), tried on each
  command a line runs, and a guard that keeps agents from rewriting the
  gate's own binaries and hook files. Pushes are free to your own unreleased
  repositories and cite a decision elsewhere.
- Decisions with more than one defensible answer go to personas, voters with
  a view of their own, and settle by trust-weighted
  [consensus](https://github.com/leidarljos/consensus) that learns from the
  outcome. A persona can reason in a runner session it keeps.
- Deeds ([deedar](https://github.com/leidarljos/deedar)): content-addressed
  records of what a piece of work produced, cited on the ticket.

## Words

| word | meaning |
|---|---|
| seat | one agent runner on one machine, with the memory and claims it holds |
| pack | the memory store ([packset](https://github.com/leidarljos/packset)), one claim per atom |
| sitting | one piece of work on one ticket, opened by `ljos sitting` and closed by `ljos finish` |
| island | the memories a title activates, and the links between them |
| deed | a signed record of what a piece of work produced |
| card | a file the person froze; agents read it and never write it |
| persona | a voter with a view, an anchor and the domains it speaks to |

## Commands

Citing a deed names it; the bytes stay in deedar. Neither a finish nor completing a node closes the ticket; `finish --close` does, when the work is accepted.

```

## The loop, in two verbs

`ljos sitting ISSUE [--playbook NAME]` opens a sitting in the protocol's order and stops at the first store that does not answer: doctor, cards, the review clock, the island the issue's title activates, the playbook copied before recall, the working set, the timeline, the claim. Absent `--playbook`, a name already bound, else a closed-set token in the title, else `sit`. The playbook name is a tracker note until finish or release. `ljos panel` refuses until one is bound. `ljos finish ISSUE --lesson "..." [--outcome OPTION]` closes it: the lesson is remembered, the island fires, the session node completes, and a named outcome shrinks the voters it refuted. The ticket stays open unless `--close` is given, which closes it only when the work is accepted. The loop that makes the seat a memory runs every time, not only when somebody remembers it.

When the tracker is a git checkout, the claim and the finish each commit the ticket's `issues.org` (that file only) and push it, so another host sees the claim and the closure. `LJOS_TRACKER_GIT=commit` keeps it local; `off` skips it. `ljos doctor` names how many commits origin lacks and fails the tracker row when that count sits through the push wait.

## Decision panel concurrency

When opening a decision panel (`ljos panel`), persona subagents run with bounded concurrency (defaulting to system parallelism clamped to `[1, 4]`, configurable via `LJOS_PANEL_CONCURRENCY` or `LJOS_MAX_PARALLEL`, or `0` to run all concurrently). When member count exceeds the limit, a detached POSIX process pool schedules members across slots without runner daemon overhead.

## Jev, where a machine allows it

`~/.config/ljos/jev.toml` with `enabled = true` and a key command hands four of the seat's judgments to Jev, TypeSafe's decision model: which claims bear on a prompt, whether the prompt corrects the agent or puts a choice, a persona's ballot, and whether an agent may stop. The local answer stays as the fallback, and a machine without the file runs as before. A prompt costs about $0.00004 and `ljos doctor` prints the month's spend. The explanation's section on judgment says how it slots into what the seat already did; the how-to has the setup.

## Who is sitting

The seat is the program that connected. `ljos-mcp` names it after the client that initialised it, and `ljos` in a shell that runner opened finds the same name through the process tree or a shared session id, so a runner's tools and its verbs are one seat with nothing set. A shell-only agent such as Grok Bot has no MCP client and no command hook, and the process tree is not its seat. `ljos onboard --harness grokbot` writes the skill and an env file; source the file and `LJOS_SEAT` is the name. `ljos hook --prompt` is the prompt hook. `ljos policy --fail-on-deny` exits 1 on a deny. Without the flag, `ljos hook` still exits 0. Claims are held per conversation; memory, ballots and trust accrue to the seat. `ljos seat` prints both names and where they came from. `ljos onboard` prints the one MCP entry any runner takes; `ljos protocol` prints the text an agent reads first.

Nothing needs a variable set: `ljos remember` starts the writer when none is answering, the seat's memory is the one workspace `seat` from any directory, and every claim carries the seat that wrote it.

## The smoke test

`scripts/smoke.sh` runs every loop on scratch stores: memory, agreement, learning, a sitting and its finish, a rewrite that closes its earlier claim, habits, an as-of read, a signed handover received and then refused after one byte is altered, a rule through the hook and through `policy`, then two seats (distinct `LJOS_SEAT` and `*_SESSION_ID` each) handing one ticket in sequence (A sits, cites a deed, hands over; B imports; A releases; B sits, both vote, consensus, finish closes, tracker git reports the commit), then `scripts/herd.sh` (eight sittings, one contended ticket, eight finishes, one island fire). `scripts/terra/` holds the Slurm scripts that build, smoke and herd the seat on the build host, as run.

## MCP

`ljos-mcp` serves the same verbs over stdio: forty-one tools, each opening with when to call it, the protocol at `ljos://protocol`, the cards read-only at `ljos://cards/`, and three prompts. `ljos_due` returns the soonest eight claims and the total still due. Paste this where the runner keeps its servers:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"ljos": {"command": "ljos-mcp"}}}
```

Unanimous green (two implementers, two reviewers, `ljos consensus` is GREEN) lives in [`examples/unanimous-green/`](examples/unanimous-green/).

A five-persona panel chose this seat's tool adapters. Its ballots, what each persona measured and both readings of the settle, before and after `learn`, are in [`examples/runtime-panel/`](examples/runtime-panel/).
